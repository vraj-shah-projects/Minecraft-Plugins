# Minecraft Plugins
A collection of simple Minecraft plugins for a Spigot server, to get acquainted with programming Data Structures and Algorithms in Java.

FireArrow: when an arrow (shot by a bow) hits a block, it is set on fire

SnowballExplosion: a thrown snowball contact with a block triggers an explosion

SpawnCats: when a cat is tamed, 10 more are spawned

RandomDrops: each block is mapped to a unique item drop. When that block is broken, it spawns a random number of the mapped item
